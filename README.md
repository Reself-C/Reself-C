My name is **Wenhao (Reself) Chai** and I am currently an _undergrad @ Zhejiang University_. 
I am also a computer vision researcher with a focus on `3D human pose estimation` and `multimodal learning`. 

I am excited to share my work and projects with the community, and I hope to collaborate with others in the field to push the boundaries of what is possible with computer vision.
